# CyberSec-Continuous-Learning

This repository contains a continuous learning system designed to detect and identify cyber threats using Hugging Face and PyTorch. The system leverages the `segolilylabs/Lily-Cybersecurity-7B-v0.2` model from Hugging Face, fine-tuned on a dataset representative of cyber threats, to adapt to new and emerging threats over time.

## Features

- Utilizes a pre-trained model from Hugging Face tailored for cybersecurity applications.
- Implements continuous learning to adapt to evolving cyber threats.
- Offers a foundation for integrating machine learning into cybersecurity threat detection and response strategies.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.6 or later is installed on your machine.
- Access to a GPU is recommended for faster processing, but the script can run on a CPU.

## Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CyberSec-Continuous-Learning.git
cd CyberSec-Continuous-Learning
```

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To run the continuous learning system, execute the main script:

```bash
python continuous_learning.py
```

The script will start by training the model on an initial dataset. It will then enter a continuous learning loop, where it periodically retrains the model with new data to adapt to evolving cyber threats.
